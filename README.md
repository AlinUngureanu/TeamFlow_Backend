# TeamFlow_Backend

The backend serves as the foundation of the application, being responsible for managing employee and department data. Its structure includes two main entities: Department, with details about each department (including their hierarchy), and Employee, which contains information about employees, including their department and manager.

It provides endpoints for create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations for both department and employees, enabling end-to-end management of organizational data. There are also custom endpoints that pull lists of employees or managers by department. These functionalities allow precise organization and control over the company's internal structures, supporting reporting and monitoring activities.
